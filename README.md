# UniformCostSearch-Shortest_path_between_2_UK_cities
Implementation of  UCS algorithm in Python using Networkx library.

The script loads a UK map encoded as a JSON file. The file encodes all the roads between major cities of the UK with their length of the road(in km). UCS is implemented to find the shortest path and the cost to get from city A to city B.
